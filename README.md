# maid-cleaning-cli

### Maid keeps the house clean.

Directories can get pretty messy. Maid is here to help. Define where which files should go and maid will take care of it.

Wouldn't it be nice to just type the word `clean` and have the current directory nice and tidy again? Or just type `list` and see the mess that grew on your Desktop over time?

Maid is your lightweight CLI utility sidekick to help with exactly that.

## Installation

```
npm install maid -g
```
